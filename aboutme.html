<p> I attended Hermon High School, and graduated with the class of 2017. During my high school career
I enjoyed spending my time doing art, hanging out with my pals, and playing sports. I played soccer and cheering
all four years of high school, played softball the first three years, and then finished up my senior year doing
outdoor track. </p>
